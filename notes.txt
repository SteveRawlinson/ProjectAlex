TODO
don't bring a non-reversible loco out unless the other one has a track available
implement three-way lock for south sidings?
JMRI: 'hide in throttle dropdown' option
make moveIntoNorthSiding use different speeds for layout -> fast/slow link
if there are no available tracks to run a class 150 on the north link get it out the way
if all the sidings are full move a loco
graduallyChangeSpeed could be more clever using minimumSpeedChange or whatever it is
remove block values on non-occupied block on startup
turn lights on
get the virgin running on slow
prioritise locking depending on how full the layout is
make sure loco is past IR sensor before part releasing lock when northbound on south link

-- don't wait for target block to be free if there's a lock and it5's a link

LS65 is dicky
LS19 is fine (and not used)









++ slow to a halt in reverse loops
