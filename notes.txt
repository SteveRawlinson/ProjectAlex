JMRI: 'select default roster group for throttle' option
graduallyChangeSpeed could be more clever using minimumSpeedChange or whatever it is
if we release a lock because no sidings, move on until we would normally stop
south sidings 2 train can break siding 3 IR
moveIntoSidings gets locks wrong because it relies on the track to determine direction
tracks should read the sensors to get u/s status
moveLocosIntoSdings should check North Link first
need to set signal aspects at startup because the panel load might be out of sync with layout signals

-- journeys should check for estop more often
-- if we give up because no sidings, release the lock
-- don't bring a non-reversible loco out unless the other one has a track available
-- long trains southbound on south link do partial unlock too early
-- don't wait for target block to be free if there's a lock and it's a link

LS65 is probably fine and not in use (despite having wires in it)
LS19 is fine (and not used)
LS5 is dicky
LS37 is connected tn Nth Siding 1 occupancy has a spare coil in case LS39 (old style wiring) goes bing - actually this has been used now


LT30 lost address 28/12/2017
LT25 failed to respond 1/1/2018
LS56 went strangely low until I pulled it out, put it back in, 10/1/2018
LT3 lost its address 26/1/2018

Javelin derailed at LT18 northbound 29/12/2017 11:00
Javelin failed to stop 29/12/2017 16:50 (might be fixed)

++ need an 'empty sidings' method
++ after getting a throttle check the slot isn't idle
++ get the virgin running on slow
++ test fast trains stopping at end of track 6, they don't stop in time
++ rotate the log file
++ if all the sidings are full move a loco
++ make moveIntoNorthSiding use different speeds for layout -> fast/slow link
++ alex.py:840 is this the most efficient lock handling for reverse loops?
++ turn lights on
++ make sure loco is past IR sensor before part releasing lock when northbound on south linkz
++ if there are no available tracks to run a class 150 on the north link get it out the way
++ remove block values on non-occupied block on startup
++ slow to a halt in reverse loops
