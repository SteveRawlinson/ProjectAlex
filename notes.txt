TODO
don't bring a non-reversible loco out unless the other one has a track available
implement three-way lock for south sidings?
JMRI: 'hide in throttle dropdown' option
make moveIntoNorthSiding use different speeds for layout -> fast/slow link
if there are no available tracks to run a class 150 on the north link get it out the way

++ slow to a halt in reverse loops
++ don't wait for target block to be free if there's a lock and it5's a link

LS65 is dicky
LS19 is fine (and not used)
