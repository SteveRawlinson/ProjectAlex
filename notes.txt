TODO
don't bring a non-reversible loco out unless the other one has a track available
implement three-way lock for south sidings?
JMRI: 'select default roster group for throttle' option
graduallyChangeSpeed could be more clever using minimumSpeedChange or whatever it is
get the virgin running on slow
prioritise locking depending on how full the layout is

-- if all the sidings are full move a loco
-- don't wait for target block to be free if there's a lock and it's a link

LS65 is dicky
LS19 is fine (and not used)
LS40 is dicky
LS5 is dicky

++ make moveIntoNorthSiding use different speeds for layout -> fast/slow link
++ alex.py:840 is this the most efficient lock handling for reverse loops?
++ turn lights on
++ make sure loco is past IR sensor before part releasing lock when northbound on south linkz
++ if there are no available tracks to run a class 150 on the north link get it out the way
++ remove block values on non-occupied block on startup
++ slow to a halt in reverse loops
