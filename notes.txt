TODO
don't bring a non-reversible loco out unless the other one has a track available
implement three-way lock for south sidings?
JMRI: 'hide in throttle dropdown' option
if all the sidings are full move a loco
graduallyChangeSpeed could be more clever using minimumSpeedChange or whatever it is
get the virgin running on slow
prioritise locking depending on how full the layout is

-- make moveIntoNorthSiding use different speeds for layout -> fast/slow link
-- alex.py:840 is this the most efficient lock handling for reverse loops?
-- turn lights on
-- make sure loco is past IR sensor before part releasing lock when northbound on south linkz
-- don't wait for target block to be free if there's a lock and it's a link

LS65 is dicky
LS19 is fine (and not used)
LS40 is dicky






++ if there are no available tracks to run a class 150 on the north link get it out the way
++ remove block values on non-occupied block on startup
++ slow to a halt in reverse loops
